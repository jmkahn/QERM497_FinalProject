"""Run experiments over a range of parameters of interest"""

# TODO: run some parameter sweeps on: 
    # * neighborhood CC (in relationship to tree cc)
    # * growth rate
    # * carrying capacity
    # * ignition probability
    # collect data on mean and sd of biomass and patch size (from 200-100 years or something)

# Neighborhood CC 
# Run over a range of different ratios of tree_carrying_capacity/neighborhood_carrying_capacity

# Choose one reasonable value of neighborhood CC 

# growth rate
# run from 0.01 to 1 (intervals of 0.5)


# carrying capacity
# run from 50 to 1000 (intervals of 50)
# leave min_seed consistent at 10
# leave ratio of tree_carrying_capacity/neighborhood_carrying_capacity the same

# ignition probability
# run from 0.000001 to 0.1 (double for each iteration)
